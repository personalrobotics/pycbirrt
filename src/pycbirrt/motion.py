"""Local-motion validation: the boundary every tree edge passes through.

A state validator answers whether one configuration is valid. A motion
validator answers whether the local motion between two configurations is
valid, and returns the configurations to store along it. The planner uses
one motion validator for ordinary growth, the final connection between
trees, and shortcut smoothing.

**Replacement, not composition.** A custom ``PlanningProblem.motion_validator``
*replaces* the default ``DiscreteMotionValidator`` and owns the validity of
the complete motion between ``q_from`` and ``q_to``, interior included. The
planner does not run the default checks alongside it. This is what lets a
backend supply continuous collision checking without paying for redundant
discrete samples, and it means a custom validator that skips the interior
is trusted to have checked it. To *add* a restriction while keeping the
default discrete checks, compose explicitly with ``RestrictedMotionValidator``.

**What the planner guarantees regardless of validator.** Every
configuration a validator returns is checked for admissibility (joint
space, state validator, path constraint) before it is stored as a node, and
a ``LocalMotion`` must satisfy its contract (see ``LocalMotion``; violations
raise ``MotionContractError``). Node admissibility says nothing about the
motion *between* nodes; that is the validator's responsibility.

**Reversibility.** The search is bidirectional: the goal tree grows toward
the start, so its edges are validated with ``q_from`` on the goal side and
executed in the opposite direction. A custom validator must therefore treat
a motion as valid independently of direction, or accept that half of the
path's edges were validated in reverse.
